  description: '1990 Vintage Gibson Explorer 76. Guitar has been well played, it does have scratches and dings, and buckle rash, its been a gigged instrument, and it 34 years old. So if you want a new one that pretty and looks good on the wall for your friends to look at, this isnt it. Lol. But if you want an Awesome, incredible playing Vintage Explorer Guitar, that plays great, and has KILLER, EXPENSIVE, Bill Lawrence HB-L and HB-R pickups, that sounds great, that you can play all the time, and banged it against something, or drop it on stage and it does not matter, than this is your guitar. I hate to see it go, it sounds great, plays great, never any neck damage, no breaks or repairs, just a really good Gibson Explorer with great pups and electronics. There are quite a few pics of it, I tried to get all that I can. I have the original Gibson Hardshell Case, the handle on the case is gone, but its an easy fix. The lock needs some attention but also an easy fix. I have another universal case its been in, but the original is the one to have. There are pics of the case as well. Will be shipped UPS and insured as all my packages are. Cleaned this guitar today, lemon oil the Fretboard and installed a new set of Slinky 10s. Guitar is ready to jump on stage with as soon as you get it. Absolutely zero problems other than scratches and dings. Feel free to check my feedback and please ask any questions if you have them.',

A long time ago my band played a show in Boulder Colorado with a band called Human Head Transplant. It is a fond memory. My recent purchase of this guitar brought them to mind. Maybe this is a Barney Lopez. The headstock of this guitar is NOT stock. It seems to have been transplanted. I think I can see that and will add more pictures. The tailpiece is vintage Gibson but does not mention Trini Lopez.',
